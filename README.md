# CSS Color Markers

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that displays three colored markers: red, green, and blue. Each marker is made up of a cap and a sleeve, styled using gradients and shadows for a nice visual effect.

## What It Does

- Shows a clean, centered layout of three markers
- Uses CSS gradients and box shadows to create depth and style
- Demonstrates basic use of HTML structure and external CSS styling

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Contains the HTML structure
- `styles.css` – Contains all the styling for the marker
  
## Purpose

This project is meant for practicing CSS layout and visual styling using basic HTML and CSS. It’s a great example of how simple elements can be combined to create interesting visuals.
